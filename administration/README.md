Upon installing, TinyShop creates a .htaccess and .htpasswd automatically according to what was entered in the admin screen including IP restriction. It is also possible to do this manually:

Example: /home/path/.htpasswd

Example Value: admin:HhSp99034

# Ip config

Add your IP:
Allow from 111.222.333.444
