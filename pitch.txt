Pitch:

TinyShop is a new webshop software package. TinyShop makes webshop software simpler, faster and better.

Online shopping will experience enormous growth in the coming years, it is expected that online shopping will increase by 300% in 2025. TinyShop develops webshop software that can compete with the big names such as Shopify. The strength of TinyShop lies in its simplicity, as TinyShop works via Excel, CSV and JSON. In this way, a webshop owner can set up and update a webshop via Excel, CSV and JSON. TinyShop also has over 40 payment gateways, which means it can be used worldwide. TinyShop targets small entrepreneurs, who usually have a small budget for software. TinyShop's goal is to provide at least 10,000 web shops with our software within 3 years. This will generate at least 100,000 sales per month, 1,000,000 on an annual basis.

Now is the time to invest in TinyShop.

TinyShop is in the start-up phase and has developed an early beta phase of the software.

TinyShop is looking for:

Private Equity, venture capital with shareholders.

Working capital of at least 100,000 euros for a period of 2 years, and a marketing investment of 50,000 in the 3rd year.

Goal: provide at least 10,000 web shops with our software within 3 years.

Current situation: early beta phase, alpha phase expected in 2021, and marketable product in 2022.

Competition: Shopify, it has over a million users. 10,000 users is easily achievable for TinyShop by 2023.

Edge: TinyShop is cheaper, 3x cheaper than Shopify. TinyShop also has the option to import Shopify's database, making the switch from Shopify to TinyShop attractive. TinyShop offers more than 40 payment gateways so that it can be used worldwide.

This is a unique opportunity to invest.
