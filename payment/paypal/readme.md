By default TinyShop supports and accepts PayPal payments. This includes creditcard payments. The PayPal integration is seamless. The installer asks for the e-mailadress on which to receive payments. There is no need to manually edit these files.

On PayPal terms, they may require a business account or business e-mailaddress. Please visit PayPal.com for more information in the event that you cannot receive or accept transactions.
